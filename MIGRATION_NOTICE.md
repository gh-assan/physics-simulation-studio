# Documentation Migration Notice

**Date**: 2025-08-11  
**Status**: Migration Complete  

## What Happened

The documentation system for the Physics Simulation Studio project has been reorganized into a comprehensive, structured system. All documentation has been moved to the `docs/` directory with proper categorization.

## New Structure

All documentation is now located in:
```
docs/
├── README.md                    # Main documentation index
├── architecture/                # System design and technical architecture  
├── development/                 # Development processes and protocols
├── reports/                     # Project reports and analysis
├── tasks/                       # Task documentation
├── findings/                    # Research and investigation results
└── api/                         # API and usage documentation
```

## What Was Moved

### From Root Directory
- All protocol documents → `docs/development/protocols/`
- All phase completion summaries → `docs/reports/phase-completions/`
- All migration reports → `docs/reports/migrations/`
- Post-mortem documents → `docs/reports/postmortems/`
- Optimization reports → `docs/reports/optimizations/`
- Technical guides → `docs/development/guides/`

### From Other Directories
- `architecture/` → `docs/architecture/` (copied)
- `tasks/` → `docs/tasks/completed/` (copied)  
- `findings/` → `docs/findings/debugging/` (copied)

## Old Directory Status

The following directories can be safely removed after confirming the migration:
- `architecture/` (content copied to docs/architecture/)
- `tasks/` (content copied to docs/tasks/completed/)
- `findings/` (content copied to docs/findings/debugging/)

## Documentation System

The new system is governed by the [Documentation System](DOCUMENTATION_SYSTEM.md) which defines:
- File naming conventions
- Directory structure standards  
- Document header requirements
- Cross-reference guidelines
- Maintenance procedures

## For Developers

### Creating New Documents
1. Follow the directory structure in `docs/`
2. Use appropriate templates from the system
3. Include proper headers with metadata
4. Add cross-references to related docs
5. Update relevant index files

### Finding Documents
- Start with `docs/README.md` for navigation
- Use category-specific index files
- Follow cross-references between related docs

## Migration Validation

To validate the migration was successful:
1. Verify all documents are accessible from `docs/README.md`
2. Check that cross-references work properly
3. Confirm no critical documents were missed
4. Test that the new structure supports the development workflow

## Future Maintenance

The documentation system includes provisions for:
- Regular reviews and updates
- Template maintenance
- Link validation
- Automated indexing

All future documentation should follow the established system to maintain consistency and organization.
