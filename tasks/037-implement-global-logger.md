# Task 035: Implement Global Logger

## Problem Description

The current logging mechanism relies on direct `console.log` calls, which makes it difficult to control logging levels, filter messages, or disable logging globally without modifying every `console.log` instance. This impacts performance and developer experience.

## Analysis

-   **Scattered Logging:** `console.log` calls are spread throughout the codebase.
-   **Lack of Control:** No centralized way to enable/disable logging or set log levels (e.g., debug, info, warn, error).
-   **Performance Impact:** Excessive logging can degrade performance, especially in a simulation environment.

## Architectural Refactoring Plan

To address this, we will implement a centralized logging mechanism:

1.  **Introduce a `Logger` Class:** Create a singleton `Logger` class that encapsulates logging functionality.
2.  **Centralized Control:** The `Logger` class will provide static methods (`log`, `warn`, `error`, `debug`) and a global `enabled` flag to control logging.
3.  **Replace `console.log`:** Replace all direct `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error` calls with calls to the `Logger` methods.
4.  **Conditional Logging:** Implement logic within the `Logger` to conditionally output messages based on the `enabled` flag.
5.  **Future Enhancements:** The `Logger` can be extended later to support different log levels, custom appenders (e.g., sending logs to a server), or more sophisticated filtering.
