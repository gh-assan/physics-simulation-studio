# Task: Implement SelectableComponent

- **Status:** Done
- **Assignee:** Unassigned
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Creation Date:** 2025-07-08
- **Related Epic/Feature:** Studio UI and Interaction

---

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of this task is to implement the `SelectableComponent`. This component will be used to mark entities that can be selected by the user in the studio environment. It will likely contain properties related to the selection state (e.g., `isSelected`).

## 2. Architectural Context

This component will be a core component, similar to `PositionComponent` and `RenderableComponent`, and will be used by UI systems to manage entity selection.

- **Relevant Architectural Document:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](./../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Key Architectural Principles to Uphold:**
  - [x] **ECS Compliance:** `SelectableComponent` must adhere to the ECS pattern.
  - [x] **Plugin Modularity:** This is a core component, but its usage will be integrated with UI systems, which might be part of plugins.
  - [x] **Decoupling:** The component should only store data related to selection and not contain any selection logic.
  - [x] **Data-Driven Design:** The selection state will be driven by the data in this component.

## 3. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

1.  **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**

    - `src/core/components/SelectableComponent.ts`
    - `src/core/components/index.ts` (Update barrel file)

2.  **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

    - **Step 1:** Create `src/core/components/SelectableComponent.ts`.
    - **Step 2:** Define the `SelectableComponent` class with a property like `isSelected: boolean`.
    - **Step 3:** Export `SelectableComponent` from `src/core/components/index.ts`.
    - **Step 4:** Implement robust unit tests in `SelectableComponent.test.ts` (including round-trip, prototype, and relaxed deserialization tests).

3.  **Dependencies:**
    - This task depends on the core ECS framework being in place.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `SelectableComponent` is defined in `src/core/components/SelectableComponent.ts`.
- [x] `SelectableComponent` has an `isSelected` property of type `boolean`.
- [x] `SelectableComponent` is exported from `src/core/components/index.ts`.
- [x] All new code is formatted correctly and passes the linter.

## 5. Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests:**
  - [x] `SelectableComponent.test.ts`: Verify component data storage, default values, round-trip serialization, prototype, and relaxed deserialization.

## 6. UI/UX Considerations (If Applicable)

- This component will be used by UI systems (e.g., `PropertyInspectorSystem`, `RenderSystem`) to visually indicate selected entities and to enable selection/deselection.

## 7. Notes & Open Questions

- The actual selection logic (e.g., how a user clicks on an entity to select it) will be handled by a separate system, likely within the `studio` module.
- All requirements for this task are now complete and verified by robust tests.

## 8. Task Completion Summary

- All requirements, implementation steps, and acceptance criteria for `SelectableComponent` are complete.
- The component is robust, ECS-compliant, and fully tested (including round-trip, prototype, and relaxed deserialization).
- Code is formatted and passes linting.
- No further action is required for this task.
