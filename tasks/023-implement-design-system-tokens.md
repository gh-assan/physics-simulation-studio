## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of this task is to implement a tokenized design system for the Physics Simulation Studio. This will ensure consistency, modularity, and ease of maintenance across the UI. The design system will include color tokens, typography scales, spacing scales, and other foundational elements.

## 2. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

### Implementation Plan

1. **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**
    - `src/styles/design-tokens.css` (create)
    - `src/styles/theme.css` (create)

2. **Steps:**
    - **Step 1:** Define color tokens in `design-tokens.css`.
      - Include dark theme tokens (e.g., `--c-bg-canvas-dark`, `--c-accent`).
      - Prepare placeholders for light theme tokens.
    - **Step 2:** Define typography and spacing tokens.
      - Use rem-based scales for typography (e.g., `12/14/16/20/24/32/48`).
      - Use an 8-pt grid for spacing.
    - **Step 3:** Create a `theme.css` file to manage theme switching.
      - Implement `prefers-color-scheme` for automatic theme detection.
    - **Step 4:** Integrate tokens into existing styles.
      - Refactor existing CSS to use the new tokens.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Color tokens are defined and used across the application.
- [ ] Typography and spacing tokens are implemented.
- [ ] Theme switching works seamlessly.
- [ ] Existing styles are refactored to use tokens.

## 4. Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests:**
  - [ ] Verify that tokens are applied correctly in styles.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - [ ] Test theme switching functionality.
- **Manual Testing:**
  - [ ] Verify visual consistency across the application.
