# Task: Refactor Simulation Studio Core

- **Status:** Open
- **Assignee:** Unassigned
- **Priority:** High
- **Creation Date:** 2025-07-09
- **Related Epic/Feature:** Simulation Studio Core Improvements

---

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of this task is to refactor the core of the Simulation Studio to improve its architecture, modularity, and maintainability. This includes simplifying complex logic, enhancing performance, and ensuring strict adherence to the ECS pattern. The refactor should also make the core more extensible for future features and plugins.

## 2. Architectural Context

- **Relevant Architectural Document:** [Link to ARCHITECTURE.md](./../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Key Architectural Principles to Uphold:**
  - [x] **ECS Compliance:** Ensure all core systems and components adhere to the ECS pattern.
  - [x] **Modularity:** Maintain a clear separation of concerns between systems, components, and utilities.
  - [x] **Extensibility:** Design the core to support future features and plugins with minimal changes.
  - [x] **Performance Optimization:** Ensure the core can handle large-scale simulations efficiently.

## 3. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

1.  **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**

    - `src/studio/Studio.ts`
    - `src/studio/uiManager.ts`
    - `src/studio/systems/PropertyInspectorSystem.ts`
    - `src/studio/systems/RenderSystem.ts`
    - `src/studio/systems/SceneSerializer.ts`
    - `src/studio/helpers/locationHelper.ts`
    - `src/studio/utils/StudioUtils.ts` (New file for shared utilities)
    - `src/studio/types.ts` (New file for shared types/interfaces)

2.  **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

    - Step 1: Analyze the current core files to identify reusable logic, interfaces, and types.
    - Step 2: Create `src/studio/types.ts` and move all shared types/interfaces (e.g., for entities, components, and systems) into this file.
    - Step 3: Create `src/studio/utils/StudioUtils.ts` and move reusable utility functions (e.g., for DOM manipulation, event handling) into this file.
    - Step 4: Refactor `Studio.ts` to simplify its initialization logic and delegate tasks to helper functions or systems.
    - Step 5: Refactor `uiManager.ts` to improve its modularity and ensure it only handles UI-related logic.
    - Step 6: Simplify and modularize the `PropertyInspectorSystem.ts`, `RenderSystem.ts`, and `SceneSerializer.ts` by extracting complex logic into helper functions or utilities.
    - Step 7: Optimize `locationHelper.ts` for performance and ensure it adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.
    - Step 8: Add comprehensive unit tests for all refactored files and new utilities.
    - Step 9: Update existing integration tests to reflect the refactored structure and ensure they continue to pass.
    - Step 10: Add comments and documentation to the refactored code for better maintainability.
    - Step 11: Review and optimize ECS query patterns within systems.
    - Step 12: Evaluate and improve the `EventEmitter` implementation for performance and type safety.

3.  **Dependencies:**
    - None directly, but this task should be completed before adding new features to the Simulation Studio core.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All shared types/interfaces are extracted to `src/studio/types.ts`.
- [ ] All reusable utility functions are extracted to `src/studio/utils/StudioUtils.ts`.

- [ ] `locationHelper.ts` is optimized and adheres to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [ ] Comprehensive unit tests are added for all refactored files and new utilities.
- [ ] The core passes all existing and new tests.
- [ ] Code quality checks (e.g., linting, formatting) pass without errors.
- [ ] No performance regressions are introduced.
- [ ] ECS query patterns are optimized for performance.
