# Task: Refactor Flag Simulation Plugin

- **Status:** Completed
- **Assignee:** Unassigned
- **Priority:** High
- **Creation Date:** 2025-07-10
- **Related Epic/Feature:** Flag Simulation Improvements

---

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of this task is to refactor the flag simulation plugin to improve its readability, modularity, and maintainability. This includes breaking down long files, simplifying complex logic, and ensuring strict adherence to the ECS pattern.

## 2. Architectural Context

- **Relevant Architectural Document:** [Link to ARCHITECTURE.md](./../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Key Architectural Principles to Uphold:**
  - [x] **ECS Compliance:** Ensure the `FlagSystem` and `FlagComponent` adhere to the ECS pattern.
  - [x] **Plugin Modularity:** Maintain self-contained logic within the flag simulation plugin.
  - [x] **Decoupling:** Separate simulation logic from rendering and UI concerns.

## 3. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

1.  **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**

    - `src/plugins/flag-simulation/FlagSystem.ts`
    - `src/plugins/flag-simulation/FlagComponent.ts`
    - `src/plugins/flag-simulation/utils/PhysicsHelpers.ts`

2.  **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

    - Step 1: Extract helper functions from `FlagSystem.ts` (e.g., `applyForces`, `initializeFlagPhysics`).
    - Step 2: Modularize `FlagComponent.ts` by moving utility functions to a new `PhysicsHelpers.ts` file.
    - Step 3: Simplify nested loops and conditionals in `FlagSystem.update()`.
    - Step 4: Add unit tests for new helper functions to ensure correctness.

3.  **Dependencies:**
    - None directly, but this task should be completed before adding new features to the flag simulation plugin.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] `FlagSystem.ts` and `FlagComponent.ts` are modularized and adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [ ] Complex logic in `FlagSystem.update()` is simplified and extracted into helper functions.
- [ ] Unit tests are added for all new helper functions.
- [ ] The flag simulation plugin passes all existing and new tests.
