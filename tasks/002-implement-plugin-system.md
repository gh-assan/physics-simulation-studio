# Task: Implement the Plugin Management System

- **Status:** Not Started
- **Assignee:** Unassigned
- **Priority:** High
- **Creation Date:** 2025-07-08
- **Related Epic/Feature:** Core Architecture Implementation

---

## 1. Overview & Goal

With the core ECS framework in place, the goal of this task is to build the second pillar of the architecture: the plugin management system. This system will allow the application to discover, load, and integrate external simulation modules in a standardized way. This task involves creating the plugin contract (interface) and the central `PluginManager` responsible for their lifecycle.

## 2. Architectural Context

This task directly implements the plugin-based architecture described in the `ARCHITECTURE.md`.

- **Relevant Architectural Document:** [ARCHITECTURE.md](./../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Key Architectural Principles to Uphold:**
  - [X] **ECS Compliance:** The plugin system will interact directly with the ECS `World` to register new components and systems.
  - [X] **Plugin Modularity:** This task defines the very contract (`ISimulationPlugin`) that enables modularity.
  - [X] **Decoupling:** The `PluginManager` will act as a broker, ensuring the core application does not have direct dependencies on any specific plugin.
  - [ ] **Data-Driven Design:** Not the primary focus, but the plugins themselves will enable a data-driven approach.

## 3. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

1.  **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**
    - `src/core/plugin/ISimulationPlugin.ts` (The plugin contract)
    - `src/core/plugin/PluginManager.ts` (The central orchestrator)
    - `src/core/plugin/index.ts` (To export the public API)

2.  **Step-by-Step Implementation:**
    - **Step 1:** Create the `ISimulationPlugin.ts` file. It will define the interface with methods: `getName()`, `getDependencies()`, `register(world, uiManager)`, and `unregister()`.
    - **Step 2:** Create the `PluginManager.ts` file. This class will manage a registry of available and active plugins.
    - **Step 3:** Implement the `registerPlugin` method in the `PluginManager` to add a plugin to the available registry.
    - **Step 4:** Implement the `activatePlugin(name)` method. This will be the core logic, responsible for:
        - Checking if the plugin is already active.
        - Performing dependency resolution (topological sort) to activate dependencies first.
        - Calling the plugin's `register()` method, passing it the `World` instance.
        - Adding the plugin to the active registry.
    - **Step 5:** Create the `index.ts` barrel file to export the public API.

3.  **Dependencies:**
    - This task depends on the successful completion of `001-implement-core-ecs-framework.md`.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The `ISimulationPlugin` interface is defined correctly.
- [ ] The `PluginManager` can register and store plugin instances.
- [ ] The `PluginManager` can activate a simple plugin with no dependencies.
- [ ] The `PluginManager` correctly identifies and activates dependencies in the correct order before activating the requested plugin.
- [ ] The `activatePlugin` method correctly calls the `register` method on the plugin instance, passing the `World` object.
- [ ] Attempting to activate a plugin with missing dependencies throws an error.
- [ ] All new code is formatted correctly and passes the linter.

## 5. Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests:**
  - [ ] `PluginManager.test.ts`: This will be the primary test file.
    - Test that a plugin can be registered.
    - Test that a simple plugin can be activated.
    - Test that a plugin with a single dependency is activated in the correct order.
    - Test that a plugin with a complex, multi-level dependency graph is activated in the correct order.
    - Test that activation fails if a dependency is missing.
    - Test that the `register` method of the mock plugins is called with the correct arguments.

## 6. UI/UX Considerations (If Applicable)

- None. This is a core, non-visual, framework task. The `uiManager` parameter in the `register` method will be mocked for now.

## 7. Notes & Open Questions

- The dependency resolution can be implemented using a topological sort algorithm. A simple depth-first search approach should suffice for this.
- The `uiManager` will be a placeholder/mock object for now. Its actual implementation will be part of a future UI-focused task.
