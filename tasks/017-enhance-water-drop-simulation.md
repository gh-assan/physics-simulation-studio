# Task: Enhance Water Drop Simulation Plugin

- **Status:** Open
- **Assignee:** Unassigned
- **Priority:** High
- **Creation Date:** 2025-07-09
- **Related Epic/Feature:** Water Drop Simulation Improvements

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of this task is to enhance the water drop simulation plugin by introducing advanced physics, improving performance, and adding interactivity and visual effects. This will make the simulation more realistic and engaging while maintaining modularity and performance.

## 2. Architectural Context

- **Relevant Architectural Document:** [Link to ARCHITECTURE.md](./../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Key Architectural Principles to Uphold:**
  - [x] **ECS Compliance:** Ensure the `WaterSystem` and `WaterComponents` adhere to the ECS pattern.
  - [x] **Plugin Modularity:** Maintain self-contained logic within the water drop simulation plugin.
  - [x] **Performance Optimization:** Ensure the simulation runs efficiently even with a large number of droplets.

## 3. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

1.  **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**

  - `src/plugins/water-simulation/WaterSystem.ts`
  - `src/plugins/water-simulation/WaterComponents.ts`
  - `src/plugins/water-simulation/utils/WaterPhysicsHelpers.ts`
  - `src/plugins/water-simulation/types.ts`
  - `src/plugins/water-simulation/utils/Vector3.ts`

2.  **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

  - Step 1: Introduce surface tension and cohesion forces to simulate realistic water droplet interactions.
  - Step 2: Implement collision detection and handling for droplets, including merging and splitting behaviors.
  - Step 3: Add support for environmental effects such as wind, temperature, and gravity controls.
  - Step 4: Enhance rendering with particle-based effects, realistic lighting, and ripple shaders.
  - Step 5: Optimize performance using spatial partitioning (e.g., quadtrees) and parallel processing (e.g., Web Workers or WebGPU).
  - Step 6: Add interactivity, allowing users to manipulate droplets and environmental conditions.
  - Step 7: Update unit and integration tests to cover new features and ensure correctness.
  - Step 8: Add benchmarks to measure performance improvements and ensure no regressions.
  - Step 9: Document the new features and provide interactive examples or demos.

3.  **Dependencies:**
  - Refactored water drop simulation plugin (Task 016).
