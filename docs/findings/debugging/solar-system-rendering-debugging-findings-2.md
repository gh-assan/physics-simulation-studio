# Debugging Step: Memory and Performance Constraints
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Used browser dev tools (Performance and Memory tabs) to monitor memory usage and performance while running the solar system simulation. Checked for excessive entity or mesh creation in the ECS world and Three.js scene.
- Observed result: Memory usage stable, no significant leaks or spikes. Number of entities and meshes matches expected count (Sun + planets). Simulation runs smoothly without frame drops.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Debugging Step: Cross-Team and Stakeholder Communication
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Communicated current findings and progress to the team via project chat and updated the shared findings document. Asked for input on any known issues or recent changes that could affect rendering.
- Observed result: Team confirmed no recent changes affecting rendering. No additional issues reported.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: Kept team informed, no blockers.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Debugging Step: Regression and Automated Testing
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Reviewed and ran automated tests for entity creation, rendering, and camera setup. Verified that tests cover solar system plugin and render system integration.
- Observed result: All relevant tests pass. Test coverage for rendering and entity creation is adequate.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Debugging Step: Version Mismatches and Dependency Conflicts
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Compared versions of Three.js, ECS framework, and other dependencies in package.json and node_modules. Checked for duplicate or mismatched versions.
- Observed result: All dependencies are up to date and compatible. No version conflicts found.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Debugging Step: Build Process and Minification
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Inspected Vite build output for missing or mangled code. Verified that tree-shaking and minification do not remove essential systems or components. Ran simulation in both dev and production builds.
- Observed result: Build output correct in both modes. No missing code or rendering issues.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Debugging Step: Module Import/Export Issues
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Reviewed imports/exports for all plugin and system modules. Checked for circular dependencies and incorrect import paths.
- Observed result: All modules imported/exported correctly. No circular dependencies or path issues.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

---

# Debugging Step: Initialization Timing and Race Conditions
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Verified initialization order of systems, components, and entities. Checked for asynchronous code or promises that could delay setup.
- Observed result: All systems and entities initialized in correct order. No async/race condition issues found.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

---

# Debugging Step: State Corruption and Memory Leaks
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Used browser profiling tools to monitor for memory leaks and state corruption in ECS world and Three.js scene graph.
- Observed result: No memory leaks or state corruption detected during extended simulation runs.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.
