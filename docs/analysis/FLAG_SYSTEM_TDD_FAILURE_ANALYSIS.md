# Flag System TDD Test Failure Analysis

## 1. Overview

The current goal is to fix the flag simulation using a strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. A robust test case, `test/tdd/flag-simulation-system.tdd.test.ts`, has been created to verify the movement of a simulated point on the flag. This test is currently failing, which aligns with the "Red" phase of the TDD cycle.

## 2. The Problem

The TDD test fails with the following error:

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'position')
```

This error occurs within the test file when it attempts to access `flagComponent.points[1].position` after the flag entity has been created by the `FlagSystem`.

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

The `TypeError` indicates that the `points` array within the `FlagComponent` is not being initialized correctly by the `FlagSystem.createFlag` method.

- The `FlagSystem` is responsible for creating the flag entity and attaching a `FlagComponent`.
- The `createFlag` method is intended to instantiate the `FlagAlgorithm` and use its generated points (`this.algorithm.points`) to populate the `FlagComponent`.
- The error confirms that the `points` property of the `FlagComponent` is `undefined` at the point the test attempts to access it. The data generated by the `FlagAlgorithm` is not being successfully passed to the `FlagComponent` upon its creation.

## 4. Immediate Action Plan

The immediate priority is to fix the `TypeError` to ensure the test fails for the *correct* reason (i.e., the simulation logic is not yet implemented).

1.  **Debug `FlagSystem.createFlag`**: Inspect the method in `src/plugins/flag-simulation/FlagSystem.ts`.
2.  **Correct Initialization**: Modify the `addComponent` call within `createFlag` to ensure that the `points` array from the `FlagAlgorithm` is properly assigned to the new `FlagComponent` instance.
3.  **Run Test**: Re-run the TDD test. The expected outcome is that the `TypeError` is resolved, but the test still fails because the assertion for position change (`expect(initialPosition.x).not.toEqual(finalPosition.x)`) will be false. This will correctly set the stage for the "Green" phase.
