## 1. Overview & Goal

This task aims to improve the overall code quality of the project by addressing issues related to readability, file length, nested loops, and mixing of concerns. The primary objective is to make the codebase easier to understand, maintain, and extend, thereby reducing technical debt and improving developer productivity.

## 2. Architectural Context

- **Relevant Architectural Document:** [Link to ARCHITECTURE.md](./../architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **Key Architectural Principles to Uphold:**
  - [x] **ECS Compliance:** Ensure refactoring adheres to the ECS pattern.
  - [x] **Plugin Modularity:** Maintain self-contained plugins.
  - [x] **Decoupling:** Further decouple logic (e.g., simulation vs. rendering, systems communicating via components).
  - [x] **Data-Driven Design:** Promote data-driven design where applicable.

## 3. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

1.  **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**

    - Identify long files and break them down into smaller, more focused modules/classes.
    - Refactor functions/methods with high cyclomatic complexity (e.g., due to nested loops or extensive conditional logic).
    - Separate concerns in classes/modules where responsibilities are mixed.

2.  **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

    - **Identify Targets:** Use code analysis tools (if available, otherwise manual inspection) to identify files/functions that are excessively long, have deep nesting, or exhibit mixed responsibilities.
    - **Break Down Long Files:** For identified long files, create new modules or classes to encapsulate related logic, reducing the file size and improving readability.
    - **Simplify Complex Logic:** Refactor nested loops and complex conditional statements into simpler, more manageable structures or helper functions.
    - **Separate Concerns:** Identify and extract distinct responsibilities from classes/modules that currently handle multiple unrelated tasks. Create new classes or modules for these extracted concerns.
    - **Improve Naming:** Ensure variable, function, and class names are clear, concise, and accurately reflect their purpose.
    - **Add Comments (Sparsely):** Add comments only where necessary to explain _why_ a particular approach was taken, especially for complex logic. Avoid comments that merely describe _what_ the code does.
    - **Review Imports:** Optimize import statements to be specific and avoid unnecessary imports.

3.  **Dependencies:**
    - None directly, but this task should ideally be prioritized before new feature development to prevent further accumulation of technical debt.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Codebase readability is significantly improved.
- [ ] Files identified as "long" are broken down into smaller, logical units.
- [ ] Nested loops and complex conditional logic are simplified.
- [ ] Classes and modules adhere more strictly to the Single Responsibility Principle.
- [ ] All existing tests pass after refactoring.
- [ ] No new linting errors or warnings are introduced.
- [ ] Code formatting is consistent throughout the refactored areas.

## 5. Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests:** Ensure existing unit tests continue to pass after refactoring. If new, smaller units of code are created, write new unit tests for them.
- **Integration Tests:** Verify that refactored modules/classes integrate correctly with the rest of the system.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform manual checks of affected features to ensure no regressions were introduced.

## 6. UI/UX Considerations (If Applicable)

- None directly, as this is a code quality refactoring task.

## 7. Notes & Open Questions

- Prioritize refactoring in core modules and frequently modified areas.
- Consider introducing static analysis tools for code complexity if not already in use.
