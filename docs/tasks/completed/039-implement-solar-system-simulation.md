# Task 039: Implement Solar System Simulation

## Description

This task involves creating a new simulation plugin for a solar system. The simulation will model the Sun, planets, and their orbits. It will allow users to interact with the simulation through a parameter panel, adjusting various properties of the celestial bodies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A new `solar-system` plugin is created in the `src/plugins` directory.
- The plugin can be selected and loaded from the simulation menu.
- The simulation displays a central star (the Sun) and at least four planets (e.g., Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars).
- Planets orbit the Sun in elliptical paths.
- The simulation includes a parameter panel with controls for:
  - Orbital speed of each planet.
  - Scale of each planet.
  - Distance of each planet from the Sun.
  - A toggle to show/hide orbital paths.
- The code is well-documented and follows the project's coding standards.
- Unit tests are added for the new components and systems.

## Sub-Tasks

### 1. Create Plugin Structure

- **Task:** Create the directory structure for the new plugin: `src/plugins/solar-system`.
- **Task:** Create the main plugin file `src/plugins/solar-system/index.ts` that implements the `ISimulationPlugin` interface.
- **Task:** Add the new plugin to the main simulation orchestrator so it appears in the UI.

### 2. Implement Core Components

- **Task:** Create a `CelestialBodyComponent` to store data about planets and stars (e.g., name, mass, radius).
- **Task:** Create an `OrbitComponent` to define the orbital parameters of a celestial body (e.g., semi-major axis, eccentricity, orbital speed).

### 3. Develop the Solar System

- **Task:** Create a `SolarSystem` that initializes the entities for the Sun and planets.
- **Task:** The system should add `CelestialBodyComponent` and `OrbitComponent` to each entity.
- **Task:** The system should update the position of each planet based on its orbital parameters on each frame.

### 4. Implement the Renderer

- **Task:** Create a `SolarSystemRenderer` to draw the celestial bodies.
- **Task:** The renderer should use the `RenderableComponent` to create visual representations of the planets and the Sun.
- **Task:** The renderer should draw the orbital paths of the planets if the option is enabled.

### 5. Create the Parameter Panel

- **Task:** Create a `SolarSystemParameterPanel` that implements the `IParameterPanel` interface.
- **Task:** The panel should provide sliders to control:
  - Orbital speed of each planet.
  - Scale of each planet.
  - Distance of each planet from the Sun.
- **Task:** The panel should include a checkbox to toggle the visibility of the orbital paths.

### 6. Integration and Testing

- **Task:** Integrate all the components and systems into the main plugin file.
- **Task:** Add unit tests for the new components and systems.
- **Task:** Test the simulation in the studio to ensure it runs correctly and the parameter panel works as expected.
