# Task: Systematic Debugging Plan for Solar System Rendering Issue

## Motivation
Planets are not shown in the Solar System simulation. The root cause is unclear, and a thorough, step-by-step debugging process is needed to guarantee the issue is found and fixed, regardless of user intervention.

## Expanded Debugging Plan

### 1. Entity and Component Creation
- Inspect entity creation code for the Sun and planets.
- For each entity, verify:
  - It is created and present in the ECS world.
  - It has a `RenderableComponent` with geometry `"sphere"` and a visible color.
  - It has a `PositionComponent` with a unique, non-overlapping position.
  - It has a `CelestialBodyComponent` with a reasonable radius.
  - Planets have an `OrbitComponent` with valid parameters.
- Use ECS world inspection tools or code to list all entities and their components after initialization.

### 2. Render System Registration and Update
- Confirm the render system is registered with the ECS world.
- Ensure the render system’s `update` method is called after entity creation and on every frame (if a render loop is used).
- Add temporary checks to confirm the render system is active.

### 3. Geometry and Mesh Creation
- Verify the render system supports the `"sphere"` geometry type.
- Ensure that for each entity with a `RenderableComponent`, a mesh is created using `createGeometry`.
- Confirm the mesh is added to the correct Three.js scene and is visible.

### 4. Mesh Scaling
- Check that the mesh is scaled according to the planet’s radius, using a visualization scale factor.
- Ensure the scale is not so small that the planet is invisible, or so large that it occludes everything.

### 5. Mesh Positioning
- Confirm that each planet is placed at a unique, visible position (e.g., along the x-axis at its semi-major axis).
- Ensure no two planets overlap or are hidden inside the Sun.

### 6. Camera Setup
- Ensure the camera is positioned and oriented to view the entire solar system.
- The camera should be far enough and at an angle to see all planets.
- Adjust camera position and direction as needed.

### 7. Render Loop and Scene Rendering
- Make sure the render loop is running and the scene is rendered to the canvas on every frame.
- Ensure the canvas is attached to the DOM and not hidden by CSS.

### 8. Material and Lighting
- Confirm that a visible material (e.g., `MeshBasicMaterial`) is used for all meshes.
- If using a material that requires lighting, ensure at least one light is present in the scene.

### 9. Orbit System and Entity Updates
- Check if the orbit system is moving planets out of view or to unexpected positions.
- Temporarily disable the orbit system to see if planets appear at their initial positions.

### 10. Browser Console and Error Logs
- Look for any errors or warnings in the browser console that might indicate missing resources, exceptions, or logic errors.

### 11. Isolate and Simplify
- Try rendering only the Sun at the origin with a large, visible scale.
- Add one planet at a time to see if/when the issue appears.

### 12. Review Documentation and Contracts
- Check documentation for supported geometry types and rendering expectations.
- Ensure plugin and render system contracts are clear and followed.

### 13. Browser and Platform Compatibility
- Test the simulation in multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to rule out browser-specific rendering or WebGL issues.
- Check for WebGL support and any browser warnings about hardware acceleration or graphics drivers.

### 14. Resource Loading and Dependencies
- Ensure all required scripts, assets, and dependencies (e.g., Three.js, ECS framework) are loaded without errors.
- Check for missing or failed network requests in the browser’s network tab.

### 15. ECS System Priorities and Order
- Verify the order in which ECS systems (including the render system and orbit system) are updated each frame.
- Ensure the render system runs after all position/orbit updates.

### 16. Event Handling and User Interaction
- Check for event listeners (resize, mouse, keyboard) that may affect rendering or camera.
- Ensure no event handler is preventing rendering or causing unwanted side effects.

### 17. CSS and DOM Layering Issues
- Inspect the CSS for the canvas and parent containers to ensure they are not hidden, covered, or have zero size.
- Check for z-index, opacity, or overflow issues that may hide the canvas.

### 18. Memory and Performance Constraints
- Monitor browser memory and performance to ensure the simulation is not running out of resources, causing rendering to fail.
- Check for excessive entity or mesh creation that could degrade performance.

### 19. Cross-Team and Stakeholder Communication
- If the issue persists, communicate findings and steps taken with other developers, designers, or stakeholders.
- Document all attempted fixes, observations, and remaining questions for team review.

### 20. Regression and Automated Testing
- Add or update automated tests to cover entity creation, rendering, and camera setup.
- Ensure future changes do not reintroduce similar rendering issues.
### 21. Version Mismatches and Dependency Conflicts
- Check for mismatched versions of Three.js, ECS framework, or other dependencies that could cause subtle bugs.
- Ensure all packages are up to date and compatible.

### 22. Build Process and Minification
- Verify that the build process (Webpack, Vite, etc.) is not stripping out or mangling code needed for rendering.
- Check for tree-shaking or dead code elimination that might remove essential systems or components.

### 23. Module Import/Export Issues
- Ensure all modules (especially plugins and systems) are imported and exported correctly.
- Look for circular dependencies or incorrect paths that could cause silent failures.

### 24. Initialization Timing and Race Conditions
- Confirm that all systems, components, and entities are initialized in the correct order.
- Check for asynchronous code or promises that may delay entity creation or system registration.

### 25. State Corruption and Memory Leaks
- Monitor for memory leaks or state corruption that could cause the ECS world or scene graph to become inconsistent over time.
- Use browser profiling tools to check for leaks.

### 26. Security and Permissions
- Ensure the browser is not blocking WebGL or canvas rendering due to security settings, CORS, or permissions.

### 27. User Settings and Accessibility
- Check if user settings (e.g., high-contrast mode, accessibility features) are affecting rendering or canvas visibility.

### 28. Internationalization and Localization
- If the app supports multiple languages, ensure that localization does not break UI or rendering logic.

### 29. Automated Monitoring and Alerting
- Set up automated monitoring to detect when rendering fails (e.g., by checking for the presence of expected DOM elements or WebGL context loss).
- Alert the team if issues are detected in production.

### 30. Postmortem and Continuous Improvement
- After resolving the issue, conduct a postmortem to identify process gaps and update onboarding, documentation, and checklists.
- Share lessons learned with the team to prevent recurrence.

### 31. User Feedback and Reporting
- Provide a way for users to report rendering issues easily (e.g., in-app feedback, error reporting tools).
- Review user feedback regularly to catch issues missed by automated or manual QA.

## Execution
### Instructions for Following the Plan
- Assign a responsible engineer or team to own the debugging process.
- Follow each step in order, verifying and correcting as you go. Do not skip steps, even if you suspect the cause is elsewhere.
- After each change, reload the simulation and check if the planets appear.
- If a step reveals an issue, document it immediately and address it before proceeding.
- If a step is not applicable, note why and move to the next.
- Communicate progress and blockers to the team as needed.

### How to Document Findings
- For each step, record:
  - The date and person performing the check
  - What was checked and how
  - The observed result (including screenshots or logs if relevant)
  - Any issues found and how they were resolved
  - Any changes made to code, configuration, or environment
- Use a shared document, wiki, or the project’s issue tracker for documentation.
- At the end, summarize the root cause, the fix, and any recommendations for future prevention.
- Use the following template for each step:
