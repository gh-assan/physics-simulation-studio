# Task: Implement Code Quality Control

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Assignee:** Unassigned
- **Priority:** High
- **Creation Date:** 2025-07-09
- **Related Epic/Feature:** N/A

---

## 1. Overview & Goal

This task aims to establish and enforce high code quality standards across the Physics Simulation Studio codebase. This involves defining clear best practices, integrating automated tools for linting and formatting, and refactoring existing code to adhere to these standards. The goal is to improve code readability, maintainability, and consistency, aligning with industry-leading standards such as those from Google and Meta.

## 2. Architectural Context

- **Relevant Architectural Document:** [Link to ARCHITECTURE.md] (Will need to check if ARCHITECTURE.md needs updates)
- **Key Architectural Principles to Uphold:**
  - **Consistency:** Ensure uniform code style and structure.
  - **Maintainability:** Improve code clarity and reduce complexity.
  - **Readability:** Make the codebase easier to understand for all contributors.

## 3. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

1.  **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**

    - `tasks/013-code-quality-control.md` (this file)
    - `.eslintrc.js` (or `.json`)
    - `.prettierrc.js` (or `.json`)
    - `package.json` (add lint scripts)
    - Existing `.ts`, `.js`, `.css` files (for refactoring)
    - `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (for CI/CD integration)

2.  **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

    - **Step 1: Research & Tool Selection:** Identified and selected ESLint (via `gts`), Prettier (via `gts`), and Stylelint.
    - **Step 2: ESLint Configuration:** Configured ESLint using `gts init`, added globals for `jest.setup.js`, and included `jest.setup.ts` and `vite.config.ts` in `tsconfig.json` and `tsconfig.eslint.json`. Disabled problematic rules for specific files.
    - **Step 3: Prettier Configuration:** Configured Prettier via `gts init`.
    - **Step 4: Stylelint Configuration:** Existing `.stylelintrc.json` is in place.
    - **Step 5: Update `package.json` Scripts:** Updated `package.json` with `lint` and `format` scripts.
    - **Step 6: Define Code Quality Rules & Best Practices:** (To be completed - currently covered by `gts` defaults).
    - **Step 7: Initial Code Refactoring (Automated):** Ran `npm run format` to apply automated fixes.
    - **Step 8: Manual Code Refactoring:** (Next step - addressing remaining warnings).
    - **Step 9: Integrate into CI/CD:** Integrated linting and formatting checks into `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

3.  **Dependencies:**
    - None (self-contained task).

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [x] `.eslintrc.js` and `.prettierrc.js` are configured and integrated.
- [x] `package.json` contains scripts for linting and formatting.
- [ ] All existing TypeScript/JavaScript and CSS files pass linting and formatting checks without errors. (Currently, there are 0 errors, but 57 warnings remain).
- [ ] The codebase demonstrates improved consistency, readability, and maintainability.
- [ ] This task document clearly outlines the adopted code quality rules and best practices.

## 5. Testing Plan

- **Automated Checks:**
  - Run `npm run lint` (or equivalent) to verify all files pass linting.
  - Run `npm run format` (or equivalent) to verify all files are correctly formatted.
- **Manual Review:**
  - Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to newly defined best practices that cannot be automated.

## 6. UI/UX Considerations (If Applicable)

- N/A

## 7. Notes & Open Questions

- The specific ESLint and Prettier rulesets are currently based on `gts` defaults.
- The next step is to manually refactor the code to address the remaining 57 warnings, primarily `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` and `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars`.
