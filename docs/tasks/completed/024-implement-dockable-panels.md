# Task: Implement Dockable Panels

- **Status:** Not Started
- **Assignee:** Unassigned
- **Priority:** High
- **Creation Date:** 2025-07-11
- **Related Epic/Feature:** UI Improvements

---

## 1. Overview & Goal

The goal of this task is to implement a modular, dockable panel system for the Physics Simulation Studio. This will allow users to customize their workspace by docking, floating, or collapsing panels.

## 2. Technical Requirements & Implementation Plan

### Implementation Plan

1. **File(s) to be Created/Modified:**
    - `src/studio/ui/DockablePanel.ts` (create)
    - `src/studio/ui/PanelManager.ts` (create)

2. **Steps:**
    - **Step 1:** Create a `DockablePanel` component.
      - Implement basic panel functionality (e.g., drag to dock/undock, collapse/expand).
    - **Step 2:** Create a `PanelManager` to manage panel states.
      - Handle layout persistence using `localStorage`.
    - **Step 3:** Integrate panels into the existing UI.
      - Replace static panels with dockable ones.
    - **Step 4:** Add keyboard shortcuts for panel actions.
      - E.g., toggle visibility, focus panel.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Panels can be docked, floated, or collapsed.
- [ ] Panel layouts are persisted across sessions.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for panel actions are implemented.
- [ ] Panels integrate seamlessly with the existing UI.

## 4. Testing Plan

- **Unit Tests:**
  - [ ] Test panel docking and undocking functionality.
  - [ ] Test layout persistence.
- **Integration Tests:**
  - [ ] Verify that panels integrate correctly with the UI.
- **Manual Testing:**
  - [ ] Test panel behavior in various scenarios.

## Notes

- Follow the "Workspace first" principle: panels should not obstruct the 3D canvas.
- Ensure accessibility (e.g., keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
