## Overview

This directory contains all task-related documentation for the Physics Simulation Studio project. Tasks are organized into different lifecycle stages to maintain clarity and facilitate project management.

## Directory Structure

```
tasks/
├── README.md          # This file - task system overview
├── template.md        # Standard task template for new tasks
├── active/           # Currently active tasks
├── completed/        # Archive of completed tasks
└── planning/         # Future task planning and backlog
```

## Task Lifecycle

### 1. Planning
- New tasks are created in the `planning/` directory
- Tasks undergo initial scoping and requirement definition
- Dependencies and prerequisites are identified

### 2. Active
- Tasks move to `active/` when work begins
- Regular progress updates are documented
- Blockers and issues are tracked

### 3. Completed
- Finished tasks are archived in `completed/`
- Include completion summary and outcomes
- Document lessons learned and best practices

## Task Numbering System

Tasks follow a sequential numbering system:
- Format: `###-task-name.md` (e.g., `001-implement-core-ecs.md`)
- Numbers increment sequentially regardless of category
- Maintain chronological order of task creation

## Task Template

All tasks should follow the standard template located in `template.md`. Key sections include:

- **Overview**: Clear description of the task
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific, measurable outcomes
- **Technical Requirements**: Implementation details
- **Dependencies**: Prerequisites and related tasks
- **Timeline**: Estimated effort and milestones
- **Progress Tracking**: Regular status updates

## Current Task Status

### Active Tasks
Check the `active/` directory for currently in-progress tasks.

### Completed Tasks
The `completed/` directory contains all finished tasks from the project history, including:
- ECS framework implementation
- Plugin system development
- Various simulation implementations
- Architecture refactoring efforts
- Bug fixes and optimizations

### Planning Queue
Future tasks and enhancement ideas are tracked in the `planning/` directory.

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Descriptions**: Write task descriptions that are understandable to any team member
2. **Measurable Outcomes**: Define specific acceptance criteria
3. **Regular Updates**: Update task status frequently during active development
4. **Documentation**: Include relevant code examples and architectural decisions
5. **Cross-References**: Link to related tasks, issues, and documentation

## Integration with Development Process

Tasks integrate with the overall development workflow:
- Tasks align with the TDD protocol defined in `../development/protocols/tdd-protocol.md`
- Safety checks from `../development/protocols/change-safety.md` apply to all task work
- Architecture changes should reference `../architecture/` documentation

## Task Automation

Consider implementing:
- Automated task status tracking
- Integration with git branches and pull requests
- Progress reporting and burndown charts
- Deadline and milestone reminders
