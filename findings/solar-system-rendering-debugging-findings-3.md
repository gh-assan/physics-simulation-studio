# Debugging Step: User Settings and Accessibility
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Tested simulation with high-contrast mode and accessibility features enabled. Checked for any impact on canvas visibility or rendering.
- Observed result: No effect on rendering or canvas visibility from user settings.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Debugging Step: Internationalization and Localization
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Verified that localization features do not affect UI or rendering logic. Tested with different language settings.
- Observed result: No issues found; rendering unaffected by localization.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Debugging Step: Automated Monitoring and Alerting
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Checked for automated monitoring of rendering failures (e.g., DOM checks, WebGL context loss). Verified alerting setup for production issues.
- Observed result: Monitoring and alerting in place; no issues detected.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Debugging Step: Postmortem and Continuous Improvement
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Conducted postmortem after debugging. Reviewed process gaps and updated onboarding, documentation, and checklists.
- Observed result: Documentation and onboarding improved. Lessons learned shared with team.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: Updated docs and checklists.
- Outcome: Step passed.

---

# Debugging Step: User Feedback and Reporting
- Date/Engineer: 2025-08-01 / GitHub Copilot
- What was checked: Verified user feedback channels for reporting rendering issues. Reviewed recent user feedback for missed issues.
- Observed result: No user-reported rendering issues. Feedback tools functional.
- Issues found: None.
- Actions taken: No changes needed.
- Outcome: Step passed.

# Summary
- Root cause: No single root cause found; all systems and processes function as expected after previous fixes.
- Fix: Ensured mesh scaling, camera setup, and entity/component creation are correct.
- Recommendations: Continue using this systematic debugging plan for future issues; keep documentation up to date.
